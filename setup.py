    # You can just specify package directories manually here if your project is
    # simple. Or you can use find_packages().
    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:

    # Although 'package_data' is the preferred approach, in some case you may

    # http://docs.python.org/3.4/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files

    # Entry points provide cross-platform support and allow `pip` to
    # create the appropriate form of executable for the target platform.

    # For example, the following would provide a command called `crypto_gs15` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
